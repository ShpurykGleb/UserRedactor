# UserRedactor
First enter in C# WPF

Hello, this is my first public project like that. 

This program can be used for work with databases of users, that have properties : id, first name, second name, third name, live address, phone number, info about user.

You must be registered in the program if you want to work. You can register in the program in "Registration Window".
Reserve values for enter : Login - Admin, Password - Admin111.

For work with database you should choose empty .txt file, or file that have records with users in JSON. 
If you choose file with some text, all of your work will be written to the reserve database("DatabaseWithUsers.txt").
